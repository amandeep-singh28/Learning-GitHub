***GIT***
Version control system which helps us to track the history of our code.
Collaboration.

***GITHUB***
Website that allows developers to store and manage their code using GIT.

***Configuration Git***(Global Level and Local Level Configuration)
~ -> It means we are in the root directory
git config --global user.name "My Name"

git config --list

***Git Basic Commands***
(i)CLONE
Cloning a repository on our local machines.
We have two places:- Remote(Files on our GITHUB) and Local(Files on our Laptop & PC)

git clone <some link>
(We can get the link for our repo from GitHub repository, go to the repository for which you want to create the clone, Click the Code(Green Color Button), Copy the link from HTTPS)

(ii)ls
List all the files and the folders

(iii)ls -force (For mac ls -a)
List all the hidden files along with files and folders
Using this command you will be able to see .git file also

(iv)STATUS
It display the status of our code

git status

->untracked(U)
new files that git doesn't yet track
->modified(M)
changed
->staged
(Before making the changes permanent, you have to first staged your files, and then you can make the changes permanent using commit)
file is ready to be committed
->unmodified

git add<file name>

(vi)COMMIT
It is the record of change

git commit -m "some message" (Always type a meaningful message)

(vii)PUSH
(After committing the changes, the changes are only made permanent to our local machine, to make the changes to the remote machine we have to use Push command)
Upload local repo content to remote repo.

git push origin main

***The whole above process was related to, How to clone our GitHub repo to our local machine***

***Now if we want that, create a folder on our local machine and directly connect it with GitHub, Below is the working for it***
