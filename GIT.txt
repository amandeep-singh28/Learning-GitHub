***GIT***
Version control system which helps us to track the history of our code.
Collaboration.

***GITHUB***
Website that allows developers to store and manage their code using GIT.

***Configuration Git***(Global Level and Local Level Configuration)
~ -> It means we are in the root directory
git config --global user.name "My Name"
git config --global user.email "someone@email.com"
git config --list

***Git Basic Commands***
(i)CLONE
Cloning a repository on our local machines.
We have two places:- Remote(Files on our GITHUB) and Local(Files on our Laptop & PC)

git clone <some link>
(We can get the link for our repo from GitHub repository, go to the repository for which you want to create the clone, Click the Code(Green Color Button), Copy the link from HTTPS)

(ii)ls
List all the files and the folders

(iii)ls -force (For mac ls -a)
List all the hidden files along with files and folders
Using this command you will be able to see .git file also

(iv)STATUS
It display the status of our code

git status

->untracked(U)
new files that git doesn't yet track
->modified(M)
changed
->staged
(Before making the changes permanent, you have to first staged your files, and then you can make the changes permanent using commit)
file is ready to be committed
->unmodified
unchanged

(v)ADD(Staging Area)
Adds new or changed files in your working directory to the Git staging area

git add<file name>
git add .(For making all files as Staged)


(vi)COMMIT
It is the record of change

git commit -m "some message" (Always type a meaningful message)

(vii)PUSH
(After committing the changes, the changes are only made permanent to our local machine, to make the changes to the remote machine we have to use Push command)
Upload local repo content to remote repo.

git push origin main

***The whole above process was related to, How to clone our GitHub repo to our local machine***

***Now if we want that, create a folder on our local machine and directly connect it with GitHub, Below is the working for it***

(i)Firstly create a subfolder in your folder like localrepo.
    cd ..
    mkdir LocalRepo
    cd LocalRepo

(ii)Now we need to make this folder as our GitHub Repo. To check whether this is our Repo or not.
    ls -force (You will not be able to see any .git file)

(iii)Use git init, to initialize this subfolder as our GitHub repo.
    git init

(iv)Commit the changes(Thing to be noted is that, these changes are only maded permanent to our local system, now how to upload this folder on GitHub)

(v)Go to GitHub, and create a new repo, don't add a new readme file because if we will add it than we need to import that readme file into our local machine too.

(vi)We need to firstly create the origin using this command.
    git remote add origin <link> (For the link, go to the repo which you have created, from there you can find it, Run the command on terminal)

(vii)To verify it, run this command.
    git remote -verify

(viii)To check the branch name.
    git branch(For good coding practice, we need to change the branch name MASTER -> MAIN, because in the default branch name on GitHub is "main")

(ix)To change the branch name.
    git branch -M main

(x)Now we will push the folder to GitHub
    git push origin main
    git push - u origin main(If we will use this, than we don't need to type origin main again and again, we can directly type "git push")

(xi)After doing all of the operations, you can now add README.md file.


***BRANCH CONCEPT***
(i)To check branch
    git branch

(ii)To rename branch
    git branch -M main

(iii)To navigate
    git checkout <branch name>

(iv)To create new branch
    git checkout -b <new branch name>

(v)To delete branch
    git branch -d <branch name>
