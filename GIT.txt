***GIT***
Version control system which helps us to track the history of our code.
Collaboration.

***GITHUB***
Website that allows developers to store and manage their code using GIT.

***Configuration Git***(Global Level and Local Level Configuration)
~ -> It means we are in the root directory
git config --global user.name "My Name"
git config --global user.email "someone@email.com"
git config --list

***Git Basic Commands***
(i)CLONE
Cloning a repository on our local machines.
We have two places:- Remote(Files on our GITHUB) and Local(Files on our Laptop & PC)

git clone <some link>
(We can get the link for our repo from GitHub repository, go to the repository for which you want to create the clone, Click the Code(Green Color Button), Copy the link from HTTPS)

(ii)ls
List all the files and the folders

(iii)ls -force (For mac ls -a)
List all the hidden files along with files and folders
Using this command you will be able to see .git file also

(iv)STATUS
It display the status of our code

git status

->untracked(U)
new files that git doesn't yet track
->modified(M)
changed
->staged
(Before making the changes permanent, you have to first staged your files, and then you can make the changes permanent using commit)
file is ready to be committed
->unmodified
unchanged

(v)ADD(Staging Area)
Adds new or changed files in your working directory to the Git staging area

git add<file name>
git add .(For making all files as Staged)


(vi)COMMIT
It is the record of change

git commit -m "some message" (Always type a meaningful message)

(vii)PUSH
(After committing the changes, the changes are only made permanent to our local machine, to make the changes to the remote machine we have to use Push command)
Upload local repo content to remote repo.

git push origin main

***The whole above process was related to, How to clone our GitHub repo to our local machine***

***Now if we want that, create a folder on our local machine and directly connect it with GitHub, Below is the working for it***

(i)Firstly create a subfolder in your folder like localrepo.
    cd ..
    mkdir LocalRepo
    cd LocalRepo

(ii)Now we need to make this folder as our GitHub Repo. To check whether this is our Repo or not.
    ls -force (You will not be able to see any .git file)

(iii)Use git init, to initialize this subfolder as our GitHub repo.
    git init

(iv)Commit the changes(Thing to be noted is that, these changes are only maded permanent to our local system, now how to upload this folder on GitHub)

(v)Go to GitHub, and create a new repo, don't add a new readme file because if we will add it than we need to import that readme file into our local machine too.

(vi)We need to firstly create the origin using this command.
    git remote add origin <link> (For the link, go to the repo which you have created, from there you can find it, Run the command on terminal)

(vii)To verify it, run this command.
    git remote -verify

(viii)To check the branch name.
    git branch(For good coding practice, we need to change the branch name MASTER -> MAIN, because in the default branch name on GitHub is "main")

(ix)To change the branch name.
    git branch -M main

(x)Now we will push the folder to GitHub
    git push origin main
    git push - u origin main(If we will use this, than we don't need to type origin main again and again, we can directly type "git push")

(xi)After doing all of the operations, you can now add README.md file.


***BRANCH CONCEPT***
(i)To check branch
    git branch

(ii)To rename branch
    git branch -M main

(iii)To navigate
    git checkout <branch name>

(iv)To create new branch
    git checkout -b <new branch name>

(v)To delete branch
    git branch -d <branch name>


***Working***
(i)Firstly check your branch status using "git branch".
(ii)Now create a new branch using "git checkout -b feature1".
(iii)If you will check the status, you will be in "feature1" branch.
(iv)Go to "main" branch using "git checkout main".
(v)Go to "feature1" branch using "git checkout feature1".
(vi)Create a third branch using "git checkout -b feature2".
(vii)Now you are in "feature2" branch, if you want to delete "feature2" branch you will not be able to delete it.
(viii)Go to main branch using "git checkout main".
(ix)Delete the "feature2" branch using "git branch -d feature2".
(x)Go to your feature1 branch using "git checkout feature1". Now whatever changes you will do in this branch will remain in this branch only.
(xi)file1.ipynb -> "This is a new Hello". Now commit the changes.
(xii)Now your main branch has this code "Hello" and feature1 branch "This is a new Hello". Currently you are in your "feature1" branch. If you will switch back to your "main" branch you will observe that the second cell has disappeared(That's how branching works).
(xiii)Now to make this changes to GitHub use this code "git push origin feature1" we want to push the "feature1" changes to our GitHub not the "main branch" changes.
(xiv)Go to your GitHub repo you will see that it is showing something like "Compare & pull request" and if you will see the branch, it will 2 branches there "main" and "feature1".

***MERGING BRANCH CONCEPT***
After making the whole project, now if you want to merge the newly created branches with you "main" branch, there are two ways using: (i)Using CLI (ii)Using PR(Pull Request)

(i)Using CLI
->To compare commits, branches, files & more
    git diff <branch name>

->To merge 2 branches
    git merge <branch name>

(ii)Pull Request
It lets you tell others about changes you have pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub.

***Steps Continued***
(i)Go to your GitHub, you will see "Compare Pull & Request". Click onto that -> Create Pull Request -> Merge Pull Request -> Confirm Merge.
(ii)You would see that the changes that you have on the "feature1" branch would also be reflected on your "main" branch(Only on GitHub).
(iii)You would not be able to see the changes on your local machine. To sort this out do this.
(iv)Whenever we want to show the changes from remote machine to our local machine, we make use of "PULL COMMAND"
    It is used to fetch and download content from a remote repo and immediately update the local repo to match that content.
(v)Type this command "git pull origin main".
